  Thank you for using HeyCoconut! To give a coconut, simply tag one or more users and add the number of coconut emojis you wish to give each of them.
  You can also add a coconut reaction on someone's message to give them one. You can only give a maximum of *${DAILY_COCONUT_LIMIT:5}* coconuts per day.
  You can always ask for help by tagging me and saying *help*, or if you want to see the leaderboards, you can tag me and say *leaderboard*+
